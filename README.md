## How to Play

The goal of the Simon Game is to repeat a sequence of colors and sounds as accurately as possible. The game starts with a sequence of colors being displayed and played in a specific order. You must then repeat the sequence by clicking on the colors in the same order.

The game starts with a single color and adds one additional color to the sequence each time the player successfully completes a round. If you make a mistake and click the wrong color, the game ends.
